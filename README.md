# [5] TAXONOMY BACKLOG

## Backlog
To see the current backlog go to the [Taxonomy & Mappings Library](https://github.com/orgs/OS-SFT/projects/2) and go to the column "Backlog" on RHS.

## Candidates for Backlog
Below is a table of evolving candidates for the backlog of taxonomy projects

| Backlog Idea  | Supporting Information |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SBT  | AddInfo  |
| IIGCC | [IIGCC Framework for Climate Resilient Investment](https://www.iigcc.org/resource/working-towards-a-climate-resilience-investment-framework/) |
| TNFD | Beta Versions; Delta (Diff) in on beta versions; Link to UN Biological Convention; Any info on this from EU Taxonomy; We need to get the TNFD (Nature) taxonomy into Solidatus; Taxonomy per Version: The first step is to take the set of beta release versions of their framework and ingest them into Solidatus; Map Differences between each sequential version as a thread in Solidatus; this will show the evolution of TNFD. Map Proprietary Taxonomy Framework then we want to take the proprietary framework for biodiversity metrics from a partner fintech, e.g. MereMer, and see how this maps to the latest TNFD version, illustrating the differences (does it capture all TNFD, and does it add more than TNFD, and what is missing) |
| Proto-TSFD | See forthcoming research from First Derivative, Social Terrain and Foward ESG  |
| CBD | United Nation Convention on Biological Diversity. How has this been used to inform the taxonomy model of TNFD? See https://www.cbd.int/ |
| NFGS | These are related to climate risk tests. NGFS Phase 3 Scenario Explorer: https://www.ngfs.net/en/ngfs-climate-scenarios-central-banks-and-supervisors-september-2022 AND https://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/ngfs/#/login?redirect=%2Fworkspaces AND https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/data-resources |
| CAMS  | Copernicus Climate Change Service & CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring System) https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/what-we-do/environmental-services-and-future-vision AND Resources: https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/ |
