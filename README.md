# [5] TAXONOMY BACKLOG
Candidates for Taxonomy Projects
---------------------
WE NEED TO ADD A FILE /TABLE SORTABLE FOR THE BACKLOG
---------------------

## EU Taxonomy
- https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/technical-expert-group-sustainable-finance-teg_en
- EU Taxonomy tool "Compass": https://ec.europa.eu/sustainable-finance-taxonomy/ which describes access as follows - note the need to check manually for updates!
   - Users can also download the contents of the EU Taxonomy Compass in MS excel (xlsx) or JSON format.
   - Appendices are available for Annex I, Annex II.
   - As new contents will be added to the EU Taxonomy Compass in the future, we recommend that if you download the contents, you continue to check this page for possible updates and corrections.


## TNFD
- Beta Versions
- Delta (Diff) in on beta versions
- Link to UN Biological Convention
- Any info on this from EU Taxonomy?
- We need to get the TNFD (Nature) taxonomy into Solidatus.
- Taxonomy per Version: The first step is to take the set of beta release versions of their framework and ingest them into Solidatus
- Map Differences - between each sequential version as a thread in Solidatus - this will show the evolution of TNFD
- Map Proprietary Taxonomy Framework - then we want to take the proprietary framework for biodiversity metrics from a partner fintech, MereMer, and how this maps to the latest TNFD version - illustrating the differences (does it capture all TNFD, and does it add more than TNFD, and what is missing)

## CBD - United Nation Convention on Biological Diversity
- How has this been used to inform the taxonomy model of TNFD?
